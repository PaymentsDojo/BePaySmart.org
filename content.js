On this website you will find how digital payments are already affecting our everyday lives, and how new types are sure to affect it even more. Brace yourselves as you embark on a journey to find out what, and why, digital payments are, and why we use them."

                "Before the invention of money, people used barter to acquire the things that they needed. For example, if someone had cows and needed chickens, they would trade to get what they needed.",
                "This however had many problems, one of them being that it was difficult to measure how much something is worth. How many chickens would you need to exchange for one cow, how much is a cow worth in bags of grain, etc. This also presented a problem as you could want something the other person has, but they might not want what you have available for offer. This made it very difficult to get the things that you need.",
                "People then moved on to using valuable commodities as a form of currency. Salt was once used as a currency but this was also a problem-filled solution. It was hard to carry around large amounts of salt, if you needed to buy something like a house. It would also be hard to hide and store that amount of salt so it would make you a target for robbery. Salt was also not very durable, if it got wet all your money would be gone.",
                "Valuable metals then became the new form of currency. Gold and Silver were used as the most common form of money throughout history. Gold coinage began to be minted again in Europe in the thirteenth century. Metal currency had the advantage of carrying their value within the coins themselves, but the problem with this was that people began clipping off part of the coins, melting them down and making new coins.",
                "The next evolution in currency came when value was based on the weight of the metal. This made it impossible for people to make more money from clipping off pieces of metal and making more. People found it difficult to carry around gold and divide it properly so they began giving it to goldsmiths to look after it. The goldsmiths gave them a receipt saying how much gold they had stored in their vault and the receipt could be used to buy goods. This was the first form of paper money and the goldsmiths became the first bankers, using the gold that people gave them to give out loans to make more money after realising that the chance of everybody taking their money at once was very light.",
                "This was a form of token or representative money in the sense that a piece of paper might represent or be a claim on a commodity like gold. Back in this day token money would be converted to gold on demand. The gold standard meant that currency was fully redeemable in the equivalent amount of gold. This was abandoned with the outbreak of the first World War, and there was an attempt to revive the gold standard in the 1920s and finally collapsed in 1931. However, people still accepted notes and coins as they had confidence in them."

                	"As has been told on the history of currency page, currency has existed in some form or another for as long as humans have been around – through bartering to coins to cash. Physical cash and money are becoming quite obsolete and you may be asking yourself, why?",
                	"The growth of technology has led to many advances! Making purchases via card or electronic transfer are much more convenient and save time. Even more time can be saved as all transactions move towards biometric payments – time can be saved by not having to swipe your card, enter your PIN etc. All the security you need will be held within yourself alone. How many times have you lost money and just can’t find it?",
                	"That problem just doesn’t exist with biometric payments, as you’ll always have yourself when making a purchase. With the rise of credit cards, contactless payments and crpytocurrencies like Bitcoin, the need for cash is becoming obsolete.  There are quite a few factors in making the progress away from cash quite difficult. The human race are attached to cash as it’s been around for so long and it is universally used by lots of vendors and users. The restrictions that are also in place for the youth having bank accounts also play a part in people being attached to cash. It can be seen that the progress away from cash more of a slog than a sprint."

			"Put it like this, a just sounds like a kind of database with built-in validation—which it is. ",
			"However, the clever bit is that the data is not stored in a one individual location or managed by any single person. Instead, it is said to be distri
			ed, existing on several computers at the same time in such a way that anybody with an interest can maintain a copy. ",
			"Better still, the block validation system ensures that nobody can change the records. Rather, old transactions are preserved forever and new transactions are added to the data irreversibly.",
			"Effectively a blockchain is a kind of independent, transparent, and permanent database coexisting in multiple locations and shared by a community. Therefore, it’s sometimes referred to as a mutual distributed ledger (MDL). ",
			"Blockchains are incredibly secure against attacks, as a potential attacker would have to attack all the servers at once, rather than attacking one and everything going down. There could be thousands of different machines, and all would have to be attacked!",
			"This would require tons upon tons of power to attack, and that is simply too impractical.", 
			"There’s nothing new about MDLs, their origins traceable to 1976. But for a long time, they were regarded as complicated and not altogether safe.",
			"But if the registry was not owned by a central third party but sitting on multiple machines and everybody had copies, it would have resilience and looking up transactions would be quick. With the data being immutable once entered in the ledger, it would provide a permanent record that financial regulators and auditors could quickly fall in love with.",
			"In other words, it’s a souped-up audit trail for anything you like, not just a cryptocurrency. It’s not just one system. Indeed, the situation can be compared of the database revolution of the 1970s: there wasn’t just one type or structure for a database, you created the specific database you wanted for your own purposes."
